# NAM: Neural Amp Modeler

[![Build](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

This repository handles training models and exporting them to .nam files.
For playing trained models in real time in a standalone application or plugin, see the partner repo,
[NeuralAmpModelerPlugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin).

## Extensions

### Multi-Knob Extension
This repository includes a multi-knob extension that adds support for training Neural Amp Models with multiple knob parameters. It enables modeling of amps and effects with multiple controls (like gain, tone, volume, etc.) in a single model.

See the [Multi-Knob Extension README](extensions/multi_knob/README.md) for details.
